                        <p>
                            <strong>Sir Syed Ahmad Khan,</strong> one of the
                            architects of modern India was born on October 17,
                            1817, in Delhi and started his career as a civil
                            servant.&nbsp;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The 1857 revolt was one of the turning points in
                            Syed Ahmed's life. He clearly foresaw the imperative
                            need for the Muslims to acquire proficiency in the
                            English language and modern sciences, if the
                            community were to maintain its social and political
                            clout, particularly in Northern India.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He was one of those early pioneers who recognized
                            the critical role of education in the empowerment of
                            the poor and backward Muslim community. In more than
                            one ways, Sir Syed was one of the greatest social
                            reformers and a great national builder of modern
                            India. He began to prepare the road map for the
                            formation of a Muslim University by starting various
                            schools. He instituted Scientific Society in 1863 to
                            instill a scientific temperament into the Muslims
                            and to make the Western knowledge available to
                            Indians in their own language.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Aligarh Institute Gazette, an organ of the
                            Scientific Society, was launched in March 1866 and
                            succeeded in agitating the minds in the traditional
                            Muslim society. Anyone with a poor level of
                            commitment would have backed off in the face of
                            strong opposition but Sir Syed responded by bringing
                            out another journal, Tehzibul Akhlaq which was
                            rightly named in English as 'Mohammedan Social
                            Reformer'
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On 24 May 1875, Sir Syed founded the Madarsatul
                            Uloom in Aligarh and patterned the MAO College after
                            Oxford and Cambridge universities that he went on a
                            trip to London. His objective was to build a college
                            in line with the British education system but
                            without compromising its Islamic values.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He wanted this College to act as a bridge between
                            the old and the new, the East and the West. While he
                            fully appreciated the need and urgency of imparting
                            instruction based on Western learning, he was not
                            oblivious to the value of oriental learning and
                            wanted to preserve and transmit to posterity the
                            rich legacy of the past. Dr. Sir Mohammad Iqbal
                            observes: "The real greatness of Sir Syed consists
                            in the fact that he was the first Indian Muslim who
                            felt the need of a fresh orientation of Islam and
                            worked for it -- his sensitive nature was the first
                            to react to modern age".
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The aim of Sir Syed was not merely restricted to
                            establishing a college at Aligarh but at spreading a
                            network of Muslim Managed educational institutions
                            throughout the length and breadth of the country
                            keeping in view this end, he instituted All India
                            Muslim Educational Conference that revived the
                            spirit of Muslims at the national level. The Aligarh
                            Movement motivated Muslims to help open a number of
                            educational institutions. It was the first of its
                            kind of such Muslim NGO in India, which awakened the
                            Muslims from their deep slumber and infused social
                            and political sensibility into them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sir Syed contributed many essential elements to the
                            development of the modern society of the
                            subcontinent. During Sir Syed's own lifetime, 'The
                            Englishman', a renowned British magazine of the 19th
                            century remarked in a commentary on November 17,
                            1885: 'Sir Syed's life "strikingly illustrated one
                            of the best phases of modern history". He died on
                            March 27, 1898, and lies buried next to the main
                            mosque at AMU.
